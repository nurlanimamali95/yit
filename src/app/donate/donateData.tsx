      Support our CHILDREN TO CHILDREN platform, where YIT residents teach other students English Through Experience classes, Cooking classes, Bla Bla time classes, Global Citizenship Children Modules, assist in theatre productions as stage managers, make-up artists, and photographers, or simply join our projects voluntarily. As a theatre director, I encourage them with some souvenirs from the countries where I live and work, give them gift cards to book shops, or pay 5 euros per class ( refers to children 13+ only, and only with parents' permission).
Any donation from 10 to 90 euros is highly appreciated!
