# 🌈 Youth Inclusive Theatre (YIT)

A modern and accessible website created for **Youth Inclusive Theatre**, a non-profit organization that empowers young people through inclusive and creative performances.

## 🎭 About the Project

This website was designed and developed to help YIT present their mission, upcoming shows, and projects in an engaging and professional way.  
I worked closely with **the founder and director of YIT**, understanding her vision and translating it into a digital experience that reflects the inclusive and artistic spirit of the organization.

The goal was to make a website that feels creative yet clear — combining a dynamic design with accessible, easy-to-navigate content.

### 🤝 About the Collaboration

Working with the YIT founder was a very positive and human experience. We discussed her goals, values, and what “inclusivity” truly means for her organization — then turned that into a living website.
